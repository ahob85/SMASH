                Here's a picture of that one time I went hiking, just for the sake of taking a picture for my website. I wonder why people on the internet always post these kinds of pictures? Why not post a more realistic picture of you sitting on the couch playing XBOX? It's like, dude, I know you hardly go outside. Stop acting like you're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Grylls">Bear Grylls</a>.

                Anyway, I'm just filling up space. You should write some kind of personal info here. Something that helps people get to know you beyond the stats they'll get on the other pages. This is your chance to tell them what you care about, what you've already done, and what you'd like to accomplish in the future.
